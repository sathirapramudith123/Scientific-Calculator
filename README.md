# 📘 *Whatsapp-console-application* – README

> The original repository README states the *project title* as:

> **Whatsapp console application** ([GitHub][1])

## ❗ Description

This repository currently has **no description** provided in its README. The only visible line on GitHub under *About* is:

> *No description, website, or topics provided.* ([GitHub][1])

That means the README file itself **either is empty or only contains minimal placeholder text**.

## 📁 Files in the Repository

The repository contains these files (based on the GitHub repo view): ([GitHub][1])

* `.gitattributes`
* `.gitignore`
* **README.md**
* `Whatsapp console application.sln` (a Visual Studio solution)
* Likely source code files under the solution

## 🧑‍💻 What This Tells Us

From what’s visible:

* The *README.md* **exists** but currently lacks meaningful content beyond the project title. ([GitHub][1])
* Because the raw content of *README.md* couldn’t be retrieved directly, it appears to be blank or just a stub.

## 🛠 What You Can Do Next

If you want a proper **README document** for this project (explaining how to build/run the app), I can create one for you based on the repository contents — for example:

✅ Project overview
✅ How to set up the environment (e.g., requirements, dependencies)
✅ How to build & run the console app
✅ Example usage
✅ Contribution guidelines

Just tell me **which language the source code uses** (looks like C++ from GitHub language stats) and if you want it to be **beginner-friendly or developer-focused**!

If you want, I can also help you extract and summarize *actual code files* from the repo.
